In this tutorial, you’ll learn: 

- how to use the Apollo framework for iOS to consume data from a GraphQL representation of [SWAPI (the Star Wars API)](https://swapi.co/)
- and populate a simple reference app.

Along the way, you’ll learn about basic GraphQL concepts, such as:

- data types, 
- how to define queries, 
- and how to simplify consuming repetitious code using fragments.
